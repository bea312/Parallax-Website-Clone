# Visit Lake Kivu - Parallax Website

## Description

This project is a high-quality tourism website dedicated to **Lake Kivu, Rwanda**. The theme, "Emerald & Earth," was chosen to reflect the unique emerald-green waters of the lake and the natural beauty of the Rwandan landscape. The website uses a modern parallax scrolling effect to create an immersive experience, guiding users through the "Land of a Thousand Hills" with a focus on tranquility, adventure, and local culture.

## Features

The website is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Font Awesome** icons, featuring a fully responsive design that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

### HTML & CSS Elements Used:

* **Parallax Containers:** Background images that move at a different speed than the foreground for a 3D effect.
* **Grid Layouts:** Used for the "About" profile section and the 8-image photography gallery.
* **Interactive Map:** An embedded Google Map to help tourists locate the destination.
* **Forms:** A functional contact form with side-by-side inputs and a submission button.
* **Progress Bars:** Styled bars to display "Tourist Ratings" for activities like boat tours and photography.

* **Navigation Bar:** A fixed navbar that remains visible while scrolling.
* **Footer:** A comprehensive footer with social media icons and a "To the top" navigation button.
